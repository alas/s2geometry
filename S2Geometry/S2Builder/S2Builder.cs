    // S2Builder is a tool for assembling polygonal geometry from edges.  Here are
    // some of the things it is designed for:
    //
    // 1. Building polygons, polylines, and polygon meshes from unsorted
    //    collections of edges.
    //
    // 2. Snapping geometry to discrete representations (such as S2CellId centers
    //    or E7 lat/lng coordinates) while preserving the input topology and with
    //    guaranteed error bounds.
    //
    // 3. Simplifying geometry (e.g. for indexing, display, or storage).
    //
    // 4. Importing geometry from other formats, including repairing geometry
    //    that has errors.
    //
    // 5. As a tool for implementing more complex operations such as polygon
    //    intersections and unions.
    //
    // The implementation is based on the framework of "snap rounding".  Unlike
    // most snap rounding implementations, S2Builder defines edges as geodesics on
    // the sphere (straight lines) and uses the topology of the sphere (i.e.,
    // there are no "seams" at the poles or 180th meridian).  The algorithm is
    // designed to be 100% robust for arbitrary input geometry.  It offers the
    // following properties:
    //
    //   - Guaranteed bounds on how far input vertices and edges can move during
    //     the snapping process (i.e., at most the given "snap_radius").
    //
    //   - Guaranteed minimum separation between edges and vertices other than
    //     their endpoints (similar to the goals of Iterated Snap Rounding).  In
    //     other words, edges that do not intersect in the output are guaranteed
    //     to have a minimum separation between them.
    //
    //   - Idempotency (similar to the goals of Stable Snap Rounding), i.e. if the
    //     input already meets the output criteria then it will not be modified.
    //
    //   - Preservation of the input topology (up to the creation of
    //     degeneracies).  This means that there exists a continuous deformation
    //     from the input to the output such that no vertex crosses an edge.  In
    //     other words, self-intersections won't be created, loops won't change
    //     orientation, etc.
    //
    //   - The ability to snap to arbitrary discrete point sets (such as S2CellId
    //     centers, E7 lat/lng points on the sphere, or simply a subset of the
    //     input vertices), rather than being limited to an integer grid.
    //
    // Here are some of its other features:
    //
    //  - It can handle both directed and undirected edges.  Undirected edges can
    //    be useful for importing data from other formats, e.g. where loops have
    //    unspecified orientations.
    //
    //  - It can eliminate self-intersections by finding all edge pairs that cross
    //    and adding a new vertex at each intersection point.
    //
    //  - It can simplify polygons to within a specified tolerance.  For example,
    //    if two vertices are close enough they will be merged, and if an edge
    //    passes nearby a vertex then it will be rerouted through that vertex.
    //    Optionally, it can also detect nearly straight chains of short edges and
    //    replace them with a single long edge, while maintaining the same
    //    accuracy, separation, and topology guarantees ("simplify_edge_chains").
    //
    //  - It supports many different output types through the concept of "layers"
    //    (polylines, polygons, polygon meshes, etc).  You can build multiple
    //    layers at once in order to ensure that snapping does not create
    //    intersections between different objects (for example, you can simplify a
    //    set of contour lines without the risk of having them cross each other).
    //
    //  - It supports edge labels, which allow you to attach arbitrary information
    //    to edges and have it preserved during the snapping process.  (This can
    //    also be achieved using layers, at a coarser level of granularity.)
    //
    // Caveats:
    //
    //  - Because S2Builder only works with edges, it cannot distinguish between
    //    the empty and full polygons.  If your application can generate both the
    //    empty and full polygons, you must implement logic outside of this class.
    //
    // Example showing how to snap a polygon to E7 coordinates:
    //
    //  using s2builderutil.IntLatLngSnapFunction;
    //  S2Builder builder(S2Builder.Options(IntLatLngSnapFunction(7)));
    //  S2Polygon output;
    //  builder.StartLayer(new s2builderutil.S2PolygonLayer(output));
    //  builder.AddPolygon(input);
    //  S2Error error;
    //  if (!builder.Build(out error)) {
    //    S2_LOG(ERROR) << error;
    //    ...
    //  }
    //
    // The algorithm is based on the idea of choosing a set of sites and computing
    // their "limited radius Voronoi diagram", which is obtained by intersecting
    // each Voronoi region with a disc of fixed radius (the "snap radius")
    // centered around the corresponding site.
    //
    // For each input edge, we then determine the sequence of Voronoi regions
    // crossed by that edge, and snap the edge to the corresponding sequence of
    // sites.  (In other words, each input edge is replaced by an edge chain.)
    //
    // The sites are chosen by starting with the set of input vertices, optionally
    // snapping them to discrete point set (such as S2CellId centers or lat/lng E7
    // coordinates), and then choosing a subset such that no two sites are closer
    // than the given "snap_radius".  Note that the sites do not need to be spaced
    // regularly -- their positions are completely arbitrary.
    //
    // Rather than computing the full limited radius Voronoi diagram, instead we
    // compute on demand the sequence of Voronoi regions intersected by each edge.
    // We do this by first finding all the sites that are within "snap_radius" of
    // the edge, sorting them by distance from the edge origin, and then using an
    // incremental algorithm.
    //
    // We implement the minimum edge-vertex separation property by snapping all
    // the input edges and checking whether any site (the "site to avoid") would
    // then be too close to the edge.  If so we add another site (the "separation
    // site") along the input edge, positioned so that the new snapped edge is
    // guaranteed to be far enough away from the site to avoid.  We then find all
    // the input edges that are within "snap_radius" of the new site, and resnap
    // those edges.  (It is very rare that we need to add a separation site, even
    // when sites are densely spaced.)
    //
    // Idempotency is implemented by explicitly checking whether the input
    // geometry already meets the output criteria.  This is not as sophisticated
    // as Stable Snap Rounding (Hershberger); I have worked out the details and it
    // is possible to adapt those ideas here, but it would make the implementation
    // significantly more complex.
    //
    // The only way that different output layers interact is in the choice of
    // Voronoi sites:
    //
    //  - Vertices from all layers contribute to the initial selection of sites.
    //
    //  - Edges in any layer that pass too close to a site can cause new sites to
    //    be added (which affects snapping in all layers).
    //
    //  - Simplification can be thought of as removing sites.  A site can be
    //    removed only if the snapped edges stay within the error bounds of the
    //    corresponding input edges in all layers.
    //
    // Otherwise all layers are processed independently.  For example, sibling
    // edge pairs can only cancel each other within a single layer (if desired).

            // snap radius (e.g., when using the IdentitySnapFunction, or when snapping
            // to E6/E7 near the poles, or snapping to S2CellId/E6/E7 using a snap
            // radius larger than the minimum value required):
            //
            //  - First, it tends to bias the Voronoi site locations towards points that
            //    are earlier on the S2CellId Hilbert curve.  For example, suppose that
            //    there are two parallel rows of input vertices on opposite sides of the
            //    edge between two large S2Cells, and the rows are separated by less
            //    than the snap radius.  Then only vertices from the cell with the

            //    are closer than "snap_radius" to an existing site).
            //
            //  - Second, it tends to choose more Voronoi sites than necessary, because
            //    at each step we choose the first site along the Hilbert curve that is
            //    at least "snap_radius" away from all previously selected sites.  This
            //    tends to yield sites whose "coverage discs" overlap quite a bit,
            //    whereas it would be better to cover all the input vertices with a
            //    smaller set of coverage discs that don't overlap as much.  (This is
            //    the "geometric set cover problem", which is NP-hard.)
            //
            // It is not worth going to much trouble to fix these problems, because they
            // really aren't that important (and don't affect the guarantees made by the
            // algorithm), but here are a couple of heuristics that might help:
            //
            // 1. Sort the input vertices by S2CellId at a coarse level (down to cells
            // that are O(snap_radius) in size), and then sort by a fingerprint of the
            // S2Point coordinates (i.e., quasi-randomly).  This would retain most of
            // the advantages of S2CellId sorting, but makes it more likely that we will
            // select sites that are further apart.
            //
            // 2. Rather than choosing the first uncovered input vertex and snapping it
            // to obtain the next Voronoi site, instead look ahead through following
            // candidates in S2CellId order and choose the furthest candidate whose

        // interior is to the left of all edges.  This means that for a polygon with
        // holes, the outer loops ("shells") should be directed counter-clockwise
