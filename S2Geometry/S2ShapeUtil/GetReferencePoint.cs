    // Unlike S2Loop and S2Polygon, this method allows duplicate vertices and
    // edges, which requires some extra care with definitions.  The rule that we
    // apply is that an edge and its reverse edge "cancel" each other: the result
    // is the same as if that edge pair were not present.  Therefore shapes that
    // consist only of degenerate loop(s) are either empty or full; by convention,
    // the shape is considered full if and only if it contains an empty loop (see
    // S2LaxPolygonShape for details).
    //
    // Determining whether a loop on the sphere contains a point is harder than
    // the corresponding problem in 2D plane geometry.  It cannot be implemented
    // just by counting edge crossings because there is no such thing as a "point
    // at infinity" that is guaranteed to be outside the loop.
