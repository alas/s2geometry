    // The purpose of this function is to construct polygons consisting of
    // multiple loops.  It takes as input a collection of loops whose boundaries
    // do not cross, and groups them into polygons whose interiors do not
    // intersect (where the boundary of each polygon may consist of multiple
    // loops).
    //
    // some of those islands have lakes, then the input to this function would
    // islands, and their lakes.  Each loop would actually be present twice, once
    // in each direction (see below).  The output would consist of one polygon
    // representing each lake, one polygon representing each island not including
    // islands or their lakes, and one polygon representing the rest of the world
    //
    // This method is intended for internal use; external clients should use
    // S2Builder, which has more convenient interface.
    //
    // The input consists of a set of connected components, where each component
    // consists of one or more loops.  The components must satisfy the following
    // properties:
    //
    //  - The loops in each component must form a subdivision of the sphere (i.e.,
    //    they must cover the entire sphere without overlap), except that a
    //    component may consist of a single loop if and only if that loop is
    //    degenerate (i.e., its interior is empty).
    //
    //  - The boundaries of different components must be disjoint (i.e. no
    //    crossing edges or shared vertices).
    //
    //  - No component should be empty, and no loop should have zero edges.
    //
    // The output consists of a set of polygons, where each polygon is defined by
    // the collection of loops that form its boundary.  This function does not
    // actually construct any S2Shapes; it simply identifies the loops that belong
    // to each polygon.

        // loop A does not contain the point at infinity.

        // determines the face structure.  Here are the details:

        // 1. Build an S2ShapeIndex of all loops that do not contain S2.Origin.
        //    This leaves at most one unindexed loop per connected component
        //    (the "outer loop").
        //
        // 2. For each component, choose a representative vertex and determine
        //    which indexed loops contain it.  The "depth" of this component is
        //    defined as the number of such loops.
        //
        // 3. Assign the outer loop of each component to the containing loop whose
        //    depth is one less.  This generates a set of multi-loop polygons.
        //
        // 4. The outer loops of all components at depth 0 become a single face.
