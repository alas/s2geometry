// EncodedS2ShapeIndex is an S2ShapeIndex implementation that works directly
// with encoded data.  Rather than decoding everything in advance, geometry is
// decoded incrementally (down to individual edges) as needed.  It can be
// initialized from a single block of data in nearly constant time (about 1.3
// microseconds per million edges).  This saves large amounts of memory and is
// also much faster in the common situation where geometric data is loaded
// from somewhere, decoded, and then only a single operation is performed on
// it.  It supports all S2ShapeIndex operations including boolean operations,
// measuring distances, etc.
//
// The speedups can be over 1000x for large geometric objects.  For example
// vertices and 50,000 loops.  If this geometry is represented as an
// S2Polygon, then simply decoding it takes ~250ms and building its internal
// S2ShapeIndex takes a further ~1500ms.  These times are much longer than the
// time needed for many operations, e.g. e.g. measuring the distance from the
// polygon to one of its vertices takes only about 0.001ms.
//
// If the same geometry is represented using EncodedLaxPolygonShape and
// EncodedS2ShapeIndex, initializing the index takes only 0.005ms.  The
// distance measuring operation itself takes slightly longer than before
// (0.0013ms vs. the original 0.001ms) but the overall time is now much lower
// (~0.007ms vs. 1750ms).  This is possible because the new classes decode
// data lazily (only when it is actually needed) and with fine granularity
// (down to the level of individual edges).  The overhead associated with this
// incremental decoding is small; operations are typically 25% slower compared
// to fully decoding the MutableS2ShapeIndex and its underlying shapes.
//
// EncodedS2ShapeIndex also uses less memory than MutableS2ShapeIndex.  The
// encoded data is contiguous block of memory that is typically between 4-20%
// of the original index size (see MutableS2ShapeIndex.Encode for examples).
// Constructing the EncodedS2ShapeIndex uses additional memory, but even so
// the total memory usage immediately after construction is typically 25-35%
// of the corresponding MutableS2ShapeIndex size.
//
// Note that MutableS2ShapeIndex will still be faster and use less memory if
// you need to decode the entire index.  Similarly MutableS2ShapeIndex will be
// faster if you plan to execute a large number of operations on it.  The main
// advantage of EncodedS2ShapeIndex is that it is much faster and uses less
// memory when only a small portion of the data needs to be decoded.
//
// Example code showing how to create an encoded index:
//
//   Encoder encoder;
//   s2shapeutil.CompactEncodeTaggedShapes(index, encoder);
//   index.Encode(encoder);
//   string encoded(encoder.base(), encoder.length());  // Encoded data.
//
// Example code showing how to use an encoded index:
//
//   Decoder decoder(encoded.data(), encoded.size());
//   EncodedS2ShapeIndex index;
//   index.Init(&decoder, s2shapeutil.LazyDecodeShapeFactory(&decoder));
//   S2ClosestEdgeQuery query(&index);
//   S2ClosestEdgeQuery.PointTarget target(test_point);
//   if (query.IsDistanceLessOrEqual(&target, limit)) {
//     ...
//   }
//
// Note that EncodedS2ShapeIndex does not make a copy of the encoded data, and
// therefore the client must ensure that this data outlives the
// EncodedS2ShapeIndex object.
//
// There are a number of built-in classes that work with S2ShapeIndex objects.
// Generally these classes accept any collection of geometry that can be
// represented by an S2ShapeIndex, i.e. any combination of points, polylines,
// and polygons.  Such classes include:
//
// - S2ContainsPointQuery: returns the shape(s) that contain a given point.
//
// - S2ClosestEdgeQuery: returns the closest edge(s) to a given point, edge,
//                       S2CellId, or S2ShapeIndex.
//
// - S2CrossingEdgeQuery: returns the edge(s) that cross a given edge.
//
// - S2BooleanOperation: computes boolean operations such as union,
//                       and boolean predicates such as containment.
//
// - S2ShapeIndexRegion: can be used together with S2RegionCoverer to
//                       approximate geometry as a set of S2CellIds.
//
// - S2ShapeIndexBufferedRegion: computes approximations that have been
//                               expanded by a given radius.
//
// EncodedS2ShapeIndex is thread-compatible, meaning that const methods are
// thread safe, and non-const methods are not thread safe.  The only non-const
// method is Minimize(), so if you plan to call Minimize() while other threads
// are actively using the index that you must use an external reader-writer
// lock such as absl.Mutex to guard access to it.  (There is no global state
// and therefore each index can be guarded independently.)
