// MutableS2ShapeIndex is a class for in-memory indexing of polygonal geometry.
// The objects in the index are known as "shapes", and may consist of points,
// polylines, and/or polygons, possibly overlapping.  The index makes it very
// fast to answer queries such as finding nearby shapes, measuring distances,
// testing for intersection and containment, etc.  It is one of several
// implementations of the S2ShapeIndex interface (see EncodedS2ShapeIndex).
//
// MutableS2ShapeIndex allows not only building an index, but also updating it
// incrementally by adding or removing shapes (hence its name).  It is designed
// to be compact; usually the index is smaller than the underlying geometry.
// It is capable of indexing up to hundreds of millions of edges.  The index is
// also fast to construct.  The index size and construction time are guaranteed
// to be linear in the number of input edges.
//
// There are a number of built-in classes that work with S2ShapeIndex objects.
// Generally these classes accept any collection of geometry that can be
// represented by an S2ShapeIndex, i.e. any combination of points, polylines,
// and polygons.  Such classes include:
//
// - S2ContainsPointQuery: returns the shape(s) that contain a given point.
//
// - S2ClosestEdgeQuery: returns the closest edge(s) to a given point, edge,
//                       S2CellId, or S2ShapeIndex.
//
// - S2CrossingEdgeQuery: returns the edge(s) that cross a given edge.
//
// - S2BooleanOperation: computes boolean operations such as union,
//                       and boolean predicates such as containment.
//
// - S2ShapeIndexRegion: can be used together with S2RegionCoverer to
//                       approximate geometry as a set of S2CellIds.
//
// - S2ShapeIndexBufferedRegion: computes approximations that have been
//                               expanded by a given radius.
//
// Here is an example showing how to build an index for a set of polygons, and
// then then determine which polygon(s) contain each of a set of query points:
//
//   void TestContainment(S2Point[] points,
//                        S2Polygon[] polygons) {
//     MutableS2ShapeIndex index;
//     foreach (var polygon in polygons) {
//       index.Add(new S2Polygon.Shape(polygon));
//     }
//     var query = index.MakeS2ContainsPointQuery();
//     foreach (var& point in points) {
//       foreach (var shape in query.GetContainingShapes(point)) {
//         S2Polygon* polygon = polygons[shape.id()];
//         ... do something with (point, polygon) ...
//       }
//     }
//   }
//
// This example uses S2Polygon.Shape, which is one example of an S2Shape
// object.  S2Polyline and S2Loop also have nested Shape classes, and there are
// additional S2Shape types defined in *_shape.h.
//
// Internally, MutableS2ShapeIndex is essentially a map from S2CellIds to the
// set of shapes that intersect each S2CellId.  It is adaptively refined to
// ensure that no cell contains more than a small number of edges.
//
// For efficiency, updates are batched together and applied lazily on the
// first subsequent query.  Locking is used to ensure that MutableS2ShapeIndex
// has the same thread-safety properties as "vector": methods are
// thread-safe, while non-methods are not thread-safe.  This means that
// if one thread updates the index, you must ensure that no other thread is
// reading or updating the index at the same time.
//
// MutableS2ShapeIndex has an Encode() method that allows the index to be
// serialized.  An encoded S2ShapeIndex can be decoded either into its
// original form (MutableS2ShapeIndex) or into an EncodedS2ShapeIndex.  The
// key property of EncodedS2ShapeIndex is that it can be constructed
// instantaneously, since the index is kept in its original encoded form.
// Data is decoded only when an operation needs it.  For example, to determine
// which shapes(s) contain a given query point only requires decoding the data
// in the S2ShapeIndexCell that contains that point.

    //    having more edges per cell).  However note that even a setting of 0.1
    //    reduces the worst case by 100x compared with a setting of 0.001.
    //
    //  - For normal geometry, values up to about 0.8 result in indexes that are
    //    virtually unchanged except for a slight increase in index construction
    //    time (proportional to the parameter value f) for very large inputs.
    //    With millions of edges, indexing time increases by about (15% * f),
    //    e.g. a parameter value of 0.5 slows down indexing for very large inputs
    //    by about 7.5%.  (Indexing time for small inputs is not affected.)
    //
    //  - Values larger than about 0.8 start to affect index construction even for
    //    normal geometry, resulting in smaller indexes and faster construction
    //    times but gradually worse query performance.

    // Essentially this parameter provides control over a space-time tradeoff that

        // their minimum width, and 2 * (S2.kAvgEdge / S2.kMinWidth) ~= 3.1.)
        //
        // Next we consider the long index entries.  Let c2 be the maximum number of
        // index cells where a given edge E was considered short in those cells'
        // parents.  (Unlike the case above, we do not require that these cells
        // intersect E.)  Because the minimum width of each parent cell is at least
        // some fraction of E's length and the parent cells at a given level do not
        // overlap, there can be at most a small constant number of index cells at
        // each level where E is considered short in those cells' parents.  For
        // example, consider a very short edge E that intersects the midpoint of a
        // cell edge at level 0.  There are 16 cells at level 30 where E was
        // considered short in the parent cell, 12 cells at each of levels 29..2, and
        // 4 cells at levels 1 and 0 (pretending that all 6 face cells share a common
        // "parent").  This yields a total of c2 = 360 index cells.  This is actually
        // the worst case for index_cell_size_to_long_edge_ratio >= 3.1; with the
        // default value of 1.0 it is possible to have a few more index cells at
        // levels 29 and 30, for a maximum of c2 = 366 index cells.
        //
        // The code below subdivides a given cell only if
        //
        //     s > f * (s + l)
        //
        // where "f" is the min_short_edge_fraction parameter, "s" is the number of
        // short edges that intersect the cell, and "l" is the number of long edges
        // that intersect the cell plus an upper bound on the number of shapes that
        // contain the entire cell.  (It is an upper bound rather than an exact count
        // because we use the number of shapes that contain an arbitrary vertex of
        // the cell.)  Note that the number of long index entries in each child of
        // this cell is at most "l" because no child intersects more edges than its
        // parent or is entirely contained by more shapes than its parent.
        //
        // The inequality above can be rearranged to give
        //
        //    l < s * (1 - f) / f
        //
        // This says that each long index entry in a child cell can be associated
        // with at most (1 - f) / f edges that were considered short when the parent
        // cell was subdivided.  Furthermore we know that there are at most c2 index
        // cells where a given edge was considered short in the parent cell.  Since
        // there are only n edges in total, this means that the maximum number of
        // long index entries is at most
        //
        //    c2 * (1 - f) / f * n
        //
        // and putting this together with the result for short index entries gives
        // the desired bound.
        //
        // There are a variety of ways to make this bound tighter, e.g. when "n" is
        // relatively small.  For example when the indexed geometry satisfies the
        // requirements of S2BooleanOperation (i.e., shape interiors are disjoint)
        // and the min_short_edge_fraction parameter is not too large, then the
        // constant c2 above is only about half as big (i.e., c2 ~= 180).  This is
        // because the worst case under these circumstances requires having many
        // shapes whose interiors overlap.

        // Continue subdividing if the proposed index cell would contain too many
        // edges that are "short" relative to its size (as controlled by the
        // FLAGS_s2shape_index_cell_size_to_long_edge_ratio parameter).  Usually "too
        // many" means more than options_.max_edges_per_cell(), but this value might
        // be increased if the cell has a lot of long edges and/or containing shapes.
